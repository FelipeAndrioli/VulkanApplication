# Vulkan Application

As of now, this README is more to remember myself of what I'm currently working, to help me focus on the current work, 
to help me not lose track of what I'm doing, to help me remember the future work, and to set "features" for future work.

Once the engine is in a acceptable (ish) kind of state, I will change the whole README.

## Current Work

[X] - Render from Scene
[ ] - Render more than one model from the scene
[ ] - Change models from the scene

## Future Work

[ ] - Render UI components from scene
[ ] - Load uniforms from the scene
