# Vulkan Application

As of now, this README is more to remember myself of what I'm currently working, to help me focus on the current work, 
to help me not lose track of what I'm doing, to help me remember the future work, and to set "features" for future work.

Once the engine is in a acceptable (ish) kind of state, I will change the whole README.

## Current Work

- [IN PROGRESS] Refactoring
- [NEXT] - Depth Buffer
- [ ] Camera class
-  [ ] Compute Shaders

## Future Work (not in order)

- [ ] Ray Tracer??

## Bugs

- [ ] The updates happen faster when limiting frame rate
- [ ] The updates happen faster when mouse is moving on the screen
